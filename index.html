        1...f5
        2.Bg5
        {
            At this point I had not had a challenging game on Chess with friends so I went with 2. Bg5 hoping
            for the trap that arises after 2...h6. Normally I go with 2.c4 but I could not see my opponents rating
            and figured I'd go for the trap.
        }
        2...d5
        {
            Not sure why my opponent didn't just play d5 on move 1. I expected 2...Nf6, 2...d6 or 2...g6.
            Surely this is a fine move though
        }
        3.e3 {
            Closing the pawn chain, supporting d4.
        }
        3...g6 {
            This seems like a familiar dutch idea. The novice in me salivates over the open king after they castle.
        }
        4.c4 {
            Normally this is what I play on move 2 in the dutch, I figure it's best to do it now
        }
        4...Bg7 {
            Maybe 4...c6 would have been a better move. Now I get to take on d5 and chase the queen after it
            recaptures d5, gaining a tempo. Also trades a flank pawn for a center pawn. I'm happy so far.
        }

        6.Nc3
        6...Qa5
        7. Nf3{
            Now I'm trying to clear out the kingside in order to castle.
            NOTE: This move still renders correctly even though there is no space between the move and the annotation
        }7...c6 {
            I figured this was to prepare b5.
        }
        8.Bc4 {
            I want to prevent kingside castling in the immediate future. I'm not worried about b5 because Bb3 is fine with me.
        }
        8...b5 {
            At this point I'm thinking black is much too liberal with the pawn moves. I'm ahead in development,
            central control, and I feel my pawn structure is more coherent
        }
        9.Bb3 9...Ba6 {
            I notice now that if I castle, 10...b4 will attack my knight and unleash a discovery on my rook.
            I then realize Ne2 prevents material loss
        }
        10.O-O
        10...b4
        11.Ne2
        11...Nf6 {
            I now see my knight is pinned to my rook, I neglected that when I visualized this position on move 10.
            Regardless, at this point I'm enjoying my position. I feel my opponent has made too many pawn moves
            and has a weak pawn structure, b4 and c6 look particularly weak. My LSB is powerful. Black's queen
            looks a little out of place. My opponent can not castle. There are holes on c5, e6 and e5. I don't
            appear to have any holes that can be immediately exploited. The only con of my position that I could
            come up with is that my knight on e2 is pinned, other than that I was very happy with the position.
        }
        12.Bf4 {
            This is the part of the game I struggle with (edit: Scratch that! I struggle in all phases of the game!).
            I liked my position, but I'm having trouble finding ways of exploiting it. I wanted to play Ne5 but after
            a think I realized that if 12.Ne5 then 12...Ne4 and there was no way to prevent either the bishop on g5
            or the knight on e5 from falling. I wanted to keep those pieces so I played Bf4 with the idea of Be5.
            I figured my knight on f3 had more potential than my DSB and I thought black's DSB was a good defender
            that I wanted to swap off.
        }
        12...Nd5 {
            I spent so much time thinking about 12..Ne4 I neglected to think about 12...Nd5 I wasn't happy that I
            didn't consider this move. It attacks my bishop and blocks the b2-g8 diagonal that my LSB controlled.
            Either way I want to continue my plan of swapping my "bad bishop" with their bishop on g7.
        }
        13.Be5
        13...Bxe5
        14.Nxe5
        14...Qb6 {
            I'm guessing my opponent did this to further protect c6.
        }
        15.Re1 {
            I decided to unpin my rook. I had a long term plan of Kh1 then maneuvering my knight to f3 via g1 in
            order to support the knight on e5. Perhaps this plan was too ambitious and was a waste of my time.
            I also had ideas of playing f3 preparing e4
        }
        15...Bxe2 {
            This was probably a good move for black. I didn't like it as I had plans for that knight. On the
            bright side, I felt my remaining knight and bishop were very powerful and their knights could be
            stopped by using Steinitz's idea of taking away their advanced support points. I'm not very far into
            amateurs mind by Silman but I had just read about the knights and bishops and felt I was winning that
            battle. Also, if my opponent decided to castle, they would be pinned and I could start aiming at the knight on d5.
        }
        16.Qxe2 {
            I took with the queen in order to "complete my development" and connect the rooks.
        }
        16...e6 {
            I'm guessing to support d5. Looking back this also allows the King to move to e7
        }
        17.Qc2 {
            This was the point I realized I could attack c6 and black doesn't have enough pieces to defend it and
            c5 doesn't work. Perhaps I should have moved either Rac1, Rec1, or Qd4. Looking back I wish I had played it differently.
        }
        17...Ke7 {
            I really didn't see this move and I didn't realize how useful a move this was until later. It allows
            the rook to move to c8 and now the king is one move away from defending c6. I figured my opponent was exposing their king
        }
        18.Ba4 {
            More pressure on c6
        }
        18...Rc8 {
            I failed to notice the x-ray on my queen, hopefully I'll learn from this and notice from now on.
            Also the king is one move away from the defense of c6.
        }
        19. Rec1 {
            More pressure on c6
        }
        19...a5 {
            I did not understand this move at the time. Perhaps preparing Ra6. It looked like a blunder to me
        }
        20.Bxc6? {
            I was too hasty here. I saw I had 4 attackers and my opponent had 3 defenders so I decided to take the pawn.
            I should have been more patient and should have tried to get to get my other rook in the attack. After 20...Ra6 maybe I
            could have attacked the kingside considering that all of black's pieces busy defending c6
        }
        20...Nxc6
        21.Nxc6 {
            Shortly after playing this move I see how bad my decision to take on move 20 was. 21...Kd6 is gonna be a killer
            as my knight is pinned
        }
        21...Kd6
        22.e4 {
            22.Qc5+ Qxc5 23.Rxc5 Rxc6 24.Rxc6 Kxc6 wouldn't have worked. I felt this was my only hope. If 22...fxe5 23.Qxe5
            and maybe I have a shot at harassing the King?

        26...Kxd5
        27.Rd1 {
            Looking back I wish I had kept my rook on the open c-file, let the pawn go, and then brought my king into the game.
            Ironically my opponent's "excessive pawn moves" and "exposed king" are now very powerful, meanwhile my king is hiding
            behind a weak back rank and my pawns are very passive. Surely I was too hasty in initiating this endgame.
        }

            A desperate attempt at 28...bxa3 e.p. 29.bxa3 and now there's no passed pawn on the queenside. 28. Rd2 would have been
            nice, but I didn't want to get checkmated on the back rank.
